# Computational Linear Algebra

This repository contains personal exercises and project implementations developed for the course *Computational Linear Algebra for Data Science* at Politecnico di Torino.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course provides the mathematical and numerical foundations for extracting information from large datasets. It explores advanced algebraic tools designed to manipulate and analyze high-dimensional data, emphasizing the trade-offs between computational cost, stability, and accuracy.

Key topics covered include:
- **Matrix Factorizations:** QR factorization (Givens, Householder), SVD, and Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse.
- **Large-scale Systems:** Iterative solvers, preconditioning, and eigenvalue computations for sparse matrices.
- **Data Approximation:** Least-squares, interpolation, and randomized SVD (Johnson-Lindenstrauss theorem).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Theoretical properties and applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Graph and Data Mining:** Spectral Clustering and iterative methods for ranking.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main project areas:

- **📁 PageRank:** Implementation of iterative methods for computing the importance of nodes in a network, focusing on eigenvector computation for large-scale graphs.
- **📁 PCA & K-Means:** Dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. This section explores how to project high-dimensional data into lower spaces while preserving variance and identifying underlying patterns.
- **📁 Spectral Clustering:** Advanced clustering techniques utilizing graph Laplacian matrices and eigenvalue decomposition to partition non-linearly separable data.
